# Gamify: Gamification of Exercise

ESC180 Project:  
*Gamification* is using game elements such as stars and points to activities that are not games.  
This project implements a gamification for exercising such that the user is encouraged to exercise more.  
Different activities are associated with a specific number of health points and hedons.  
Moreover, users can gain stars which will increase the number of hedons they gain for the activity. Here, users can also lose interest in stars once they gain too much of them.  
The different activities include running, resting, carrying textbooks, where the time duration of the activitiy is also relevent.  
The set of rules provided by Professor Guerzhoy are:
- The user starts out with 0 health points, and 0 hedons.
- The user is always either running, carrying textbooks, or resting.
- Running gives 3 health points per minute for up to 180 minutes, and 1 health point per minute for every minute over 180 minutes that the user runs. (Note that if the user runs for 90 minutes, then rests for 10 minutes, then runs for 110 minutes, the user will get 600 health points, since they rested in between the times that they ran.)
- Carrying textbooks always gives 2 health points per minute.
- Resting gives 0 hedons per minute.
- Both running and carrying textbooks give -2 hedons per minute if the user is tired and isnâ€™t using a star (definition: the user is tired if they finished running or carrying textbooks less than 2 hours before the current activity started.) For example, for the purposes of this rule, the user will be tired if they run for 2 minutes, and then start running again straight away.
- If the user is not tired, running gives 2 hedons per minute for the first 10 minutes of running, and -2 hedons per minute for every minute after the first 10.
- If the user is not tired, carrying textbooks gives 1 hedon per minute for the first 20 minutes, and -1 hedon per minute for every minute after the first 20.
- If a star is offered for a particular activity and the user takes the star right away, the user gets an additional 3 hedons per minute for at most 10 minutes. Note that the user only gets 3 hedons per minute for the first activity they undertake, and do not get the hedons due to the star if they decide to keep performing the activity:  
```
  offer_star("running")  
  perform_activity("running", 5) # gets extra hedons     
  perform_activity("running", 2) # no extra hedons
```
- If three stars are offered within the span of 2 hours, the user loses interest, and will not get additional
hedons due to stars for the rest of the simulation.
